# Merge-Specific Agent Communication Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides specific communication templates and guidelines for AI agents performing upstream merge operations. These guidelines **supplement** the high-level agent communication principles defined in [agent-communication.instructions.md](../agent-communication.instructions.md).

**Key Points:**
- The high-level communication guidelines apply to ALL merge interactions
- This document adds merge-specific templates and formats
- Tool output templates are **MUST use** (exact format required)
- Batch summary templates are **SHOULD include** (flexible adaptation allowed)

## MCP Tool Output Templates

These templates define the **exact format** agents MUST use when communicating tool results to users.

### 1. Start-OpenSSHBuild Tool Output

**MUST use this format when reporting build results.**

#### Success Scenario:
```
Build completed successfully. All 14 executables were created:
- ssh.exe, sshd.exe, sshd-auth.exe, sshd-session.exe
- ssh-agent.exe, ssh-add.exe, ssh-keygen.exe, ssh-keyscan.exe
- scp.exe, sftp.exe, sftp-server.exe
- ssh-pkcs11-helper.exe, ssh-shellhost.exe, ssh-sk-helper.exe

Configuration: Release | Architecture: x64
```

#### Failure Scenario:
```
Build failed with compilation errors. Analyzing the build log to identify issues.

[After running Test-OpenSSHBuild]
Found X compilation errors:
- [file.c]: [brief error description]
- [file.c]: [brief error description]

I'll resolve these errors now.
```

#### Success with New Warnings Scenario:
**MUST use this format when build succeeds but new warnings are detected.**

```
Build completed successfully. All 14 executables were created.

However, new compiler warnings have been introduced:

Baseline: X warnings → Current: Y warnings (ΔZ new warnings)

New Warnings Detected:

**Deprecated APIs (2):**
- [auth.c] (Line 145): C4996 - 'strcpy': This function may be unsafe. Consider using strcpy_s instead.
- [sshd.c] (Line 302): C4996 - 'GetVersion': was declared deprecated

**Type Conversions (1):**
- [channels.c] (Line 89): C4244 - Conversion from 'size_t' to 'int', possible loss of data

**Analysis:**
These warnings appear to be introduced by upstream changes. The deprecated API warnings may require Windows-specific alternatives, and the type conversion should be reviewed for potential data loss.

How would you like to proceed?
1. Fix these warnings before continuing
2. Proceed with warnings (will update baseline)

Please advise.
```

### 2. Test-OpenSSHBuild Tool Output

**MUST use this format when reporting build error analysis.**

#### When Build Failed:
```
Build error analysis complete:

Compilation Errors (X):
- [filename.c] (Line Y): [Error code] - [Brief description]
- [filename.c] (Line Y): [Error code] - [Brief description]

Warnings (X):
- [filename.c] (Line Y): [Warning description]

Error Categories:
- Missing preprocessor definitions: X
- Windows compatibility issues: X
- Build system inconsistencies: X
```

#### When Build Succeeded with No New Warnings:
```
Build analysis complete:

Compilation Errors: 0
Warnings: X (no change from baseline)

No new warnings introduced. Build is clean.
```

#### When Build Succeeded with New Warnings:
```
Build analysis complete:

Compilation Errors: 0

Warnings Comparison:
- Baseline: X warnings
- Current: Y warnings
- New warnings: Z

New Warnings by Category:

**Deprecated APIs (2):**
- [auth.c] (Line 145): C4996 - 'strcpy': This function may be unsafe
- [sshd.c] (Line 302): C4996 - 'GetVersion': was declared deprecated

**Type Conversions (1):**
- [channels.c] (Line 89): C4244 - Conversion from 'size_t' to 'int'

**Potential Bugs (0)**
**Security-Related (0)**
**Platform-Specific (0)**

These new warnings require user approval before proceeding.
```

**Note:** ALWAYS invoke Test-OpenSSHBuild after every build to check for warnings, not just on failure.

### 3. Test-OpenSSHFunctionality Tool Output

**MUST use this format when reporting functionality test results.**

#### Success Scenario:
```
Functionality testing completed successfully!

Test Results:
✅ Administrator privileges verified
✅ Test user created: [username]
✅ SSH service installed successfully
✅ SSH service started successfully
✅ Firewall rule configured
✅ SSH connection test passed
✅ Command execution verified: "echo hello world" returned expected output

All test resources cleaned up.
```

#### Failure Scenario:
```
Functionality testing failed.

Test Progress:
✅ Administrator privileges verified
✅ Test user created: [username]
❌ SSH service installation failed

Error: [Error message from tool]

The test environment has been cleaned up. I'll investigate the service installation issue.
```

#### Partial Success Scenario:
```
Functionality testing completed with warnings.

Test Results:
✅ Administrator privileges verified
✅ Test user created: [username]
✅ SSH service installed successfully
✅ SSH service started successfully
⚠️ Firewall rule configuration skipped (SkipFirewall=true)
✅ SSH connection test passed
✅ Command execution verified

Note: Firewall was not configured as requested. Ensure firewall rules exist if testing remote connections.
```

## Commit Batch Summary Template

**SHOULD include these elements** when summarizing a commit batch. Adapt the format and detail level based on context.

### Template Structure:

```
Processing batch [N] ([X] commits from [start_hash] to [end_hash])

Key Changes:
- [Category 1]: [Brief description]
- [Category 2]: [Brief description]
- [Category 3]: [Brief description]

Files Modified: [X] files
Conflicts: [X] conflicts ([resolved/pending])

[Additional context if needed]
```

### Example - Simple Batch:
```
Processing batch 1 (8 commits from a1b2c3d to e4f5a6b)

Key Changes:
- Security fixes: Updated bounds checking in buffer handling
- Bug fixes: Corrected memory leak in session cleanup
- Documentation: Updated protocol specification comments

Files Modified: 12 files
Conflicts: 2 conflicts (resolved)
```

### Example - Complex Batch:
```
Processing batch 3 (15 commits from 7h8i9j0 to k1l2m3n)

Key Changes:
- Build system: Added new source files for MLKEM support
- Authentication: Enhanced certificate validation logic
- Process management: Modified daemon initialization (requires Windows adaptation)
- Configuration: Added 3 new preprocessor definitions

Files Modified: 28 files
Conflicts: 7 conflicts (5 resolved, 2 require manual review)

Note: The daemon initialization changes use fork() which needs Windows CreateProcess() equivalent.
```

### Example - Minimal Batch:
```
Processing batch 5 (3 commits from x7y8z9 to a0b1c2)

Key Changes:
- Minor documentation updates
- Code formatting corrections

Files Modified: 4 files
Conflicts: None
```

## Progress Update Templates

**SHOULD include these elements** when communicating progress at different workflow phases. Adapt wording to context.

### Pre-Merge Analysis Phase:
```
Analyzing upstream changes from [last_merge_tag] to [target_version]...

Found [X] commits to merge:
- [X] security fixes (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [X] bug fixes
- [X] feature additions
- [X] build system changes

Grouping commits into batches for incremental merging.
```

### Conflict Resolution Phase:
```
Resolving [X] conflicts in [filename]:

- Conflict 1: [Brief description] → [Resolution strategy]
- Conflict 2: [Brief description] → [Resolution strategy]

[X] conflicts resolved, [Y] remaining.
```

### Build Fixes Phase:
```
Applying build fixes for iteration [N]:

- Added Windows compatibility header to [file.c]
- Updated config.h.vs with [X] new definitions
- Added [source_file.c] to [project.vcxproj]

Rebuilding...
```

### Testing Phase:
```
Running functionality tests to validate the merge...

[Use Test-OpenSSHFunctionality template from above]
```

### Cleanup Phase:
```
Finalizing the merge:

✅ Restored paths.targets to clean state
✅ Verified [X] commits applied successfully
✅ All builds passing
✅ Functionality tests passing

Ready to commit and push.
```

### Scratch-to-Real Branch Transition:
```
Scratch branch phase complete!

Summary:
- Processed [N] batches on scratch branch
- Resolved [X] total conflicts across [Y] files
- All [N] batches built successfully
- Resolution log saved with [X] entries

Switching to the real merge branch for the single final merge.
Recorded resolutions will be replayed automatically via git rerere and the resolution log.
```

### Real Branch Replay Report:
```
Single merge completed on real branch. Resolution replay results:

- Auto-resolved by git rerere: [X] files
- Replayed from resolution log: [Y] files
- Unmatched (manual resolution needed): [Z] files
  - [file1]: [brief reason]
  - [file2]: [brief reason]
- Failed replays: [W] files

[If unmatched > 0]: Resolving the remaining [Z] files using strategies from the scratch phase...
[If all resolved]: All conflicts resolved. Applying build fixes as separate commits.
```

## Special Scenarios

### When Seeking User Approval:
```
Batch [N] is ready for review:

Summary:
- [X] commits merged successfully
- Build: ✅ Passed
- Tests: ✅ Passed
- Conflicts: [X] resolved

Changes include: [brief list]

May I proceed with the next batch?
```

### When Requesting Manual Intervention:
```
I've encountered a complex conflict that requires manual review:

File: [filename]
Issue: [Description of the conflict complexity]
Context: [Why automated resolution isn't appropriate]

Recommendation: [Suggested approach]

Please advise on how to proceed.
```

### When Reporting Critical Issues:
```
⚠️ CRITICAL: [Issue type detected]

Details:
- [Specific problem]
- [Impact assessment]
- [Affected components]

This requires immediate attention before proceeding with the merge.
```

## Integration with Pseudocode

When implementing pseudocode patterns from merge-details.instructions.md, use these communication approaches:

### update_progress() → Chat Message
```pseudocode
# Pseudocode:
update_progress("Build Fixes", "IN_PROGRESS", "Applied 3 fixes")

# Agent Implementation (via chat):
"Applying build fixes (iteration 2): Added 3 Windows compatibility changes. Rebuilding now..."
```

### generate_test_report() → Structured Chat Message
```pseudocode
# Pseudocode:
report = generate_test_report(test_results)

# Agent Implementation (via chat):
[Use Test-OpenSSHFunctionality template from above]
```

### log() → Contextual Chat Message
```pseudocode
# Pseudocode:
log(f"Skipping {binary} - Unix only")

# Agent Implementation (via chat):
"Skipping ssh-keysign.exe - Unix-only binary not applicable to Windows build."
```

## Best Practices for Merge Communication

1. **Always include commit hashes** when referencing specific commits (first 7 characters)
2. **Use file links** when referencing specific files: [filename](path/to/filename)
3. **Categorize changes** by type (security, bug fix, feature, build system, etc.)
4. **Highlight Windows-specific considerations** that required special handling
5. **Provide commit counts** to show progress and scope
6. **Be specific about conflict types** and resolution strategies used
7. **Report before and after** major operations (build, test, etc.)
8. **Update after each batch** to maintain transparency
9. **Use consistent terminology** aligned with the instruction files
10. **Mark critical items** with appropriate indicators (⚠️, ✅, ❌)

## Summary

- **Tool templates are REQUIRED** - Use exact formats for MCP tool output summaries
- **Batch templates are RECOMMENDED** - Include suggested elements but adapt to context
- **Supplement high-level guidelines** - All general communication principles still apply
- **Maintain transparency** - Keep users informed throughout the merge process
- **Be consistent** - Use standard terminology and formatting patterns
