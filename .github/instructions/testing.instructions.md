# Testing Instructions for AI Agents

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for validating OpenSSH-Portable merges on Windows. Testing should be performed after successful compilation to ensure functionality is preserved.

## Automated Testing with MCP Tools (Recommended)

### Using Test-OpenSSHFunctionality Tool

The repository includes an MCP tool that automates end-to-end functional testing of OpenSSH on Windows.

Use the Test-OpenSSHFunctionality MCP tool:
- **MCP Tool Name**: `mcp_openssh-server_Test_OpenSSHFunctionality`
- **Parameters**:
  - `Configuration` (optional): "Debug" or "Release" (default: "Release")
  - `Architecture` (optional): "x64", "x86", "ARM", "ARM64" (default: "x64")
  - `SkipFirewall` (optional): Skip firewall configuration (default: false)
  - `NoCleanup` (optional): Skip cleanup for debugging (default: false)

**Examples:**
- Run with defaults: (no parameters needed)
- Test with specific configuration: `Configuration="Debug"`, `Architecture="x64"`
- Skip firewall configuration: `SkipFirewall=true`

**What the tool does:**
1. Verifies Administrator privileges
2. Creates a temporary test user with random password
3. Installs and starts the SSH service
4. Configures Windows Firewall (unless -SkipFirewall is used)
5. Tests SSH connection with password authentication
6. Executes "echo hello world" command via SSH
7. Cleans up all resources (user, service, firewall rule)

**Expected output on success:**
```
=== OpenSSH Functionality Test ===
[1/6] Checking Administrator privileges...
✓ Running with Administrator privileges
[2/6] Creating temporary test user...
✓ Created test user: openssh_test_1234
[3/6] Installing SSH service...
✓ SSH service installed successfully
[4/6] Starting SSH service...
✓ SSH service started successfully
[5/6] Configuring Windows Firewall...
✓ Firewall rule created
[6/6] Testing SSH connection...
✓ SSH connection successful
  Command output: hello world

=== Cleanup ===
✓ SSH service uninstalled
✓ Firewall rule removed
✓ Test user removed

=== Test Summary ===
Status: PASSED
```

**The tool returns a structured result object with:**
- `Success`: Boolean indicating overall test success
- `ServiceInstalled`: Whether service installation succeeded
- `ServiceStarted`: Whether service started successfully
- `ConnectionSuccessful`: Whether SSH connection test passed
- `CommandOutput`: Output from the test command
- `TestUser`: Name of the temporary test user created
- `Errors`: Array of any errors encountered
- `Message`: Summary message

## Primary Testing Approach

**Use the automated Test-OpenSSHFunctionality MCP tool for all testing.**

The MCP tool performs comprehensive end-to-end testing including:
- Administrator privilege verification
- Temporary test user creation
- SSH service installation and startup
- Windows Firewall configuration
- SSH connection testing with password authentication
- Command execution verification
- Complete cleanup of all test resources

**MCP Tool Name**: `mcp_openssh-server_Test_OpenSSHFunctionality`

**Parameters**:
- `Configuration` (optional): "Debug" or "Release" (default: "Release")
- `Architecture` (optional): "x64", "x86", "ARM", "ARM64" (default: "x64")
- `SkipFirewall` (optional): Skip firewall configuration (default: false)
- `NoCleanup` (optional): Skip cleanup for debugging (default: false)

**When to use**:
- After successful build to validate functionality
- During merge process at CI checkpoints
- Before creating pull requests
- When debugging SSH connectivity issues

## Validation Scenario Override: Entra-ID Debug Localhost

Use this scenario when the prompt explicitly declares `Validation scenario=entra-id-debug-localhost`.

In this scenario, do not create a temporary local user and random password. Instead, validate using an existing Entra-ID administrator account with key-based auth already configured.

### Steps
1. Open terminal A in the build output directory and run sshd in foreground debug mode:
```pwsh
cd .\contrib\win32\openssh\x64\Release
.\sshd.exe -ddd
```

2. Open terminal B and attempt local key-based connection:
```pwsh
ssh localhost
```

3. Confirm validation success by checking both sides:
- Client side: successful login on `ssh localhost` using existing key-based auth
- Server side (terminal A): no fatal errors during authentication/session setup

### Notes
- This mode is intended for machines that already have admin key-based auth configured.
- Keep `sshd -ddd` running only for validation and stop it after the test.
- Use this scenario instead of `Test-OpenSSHFunctionality` when declared in the prompt.

## Manual Testing Procedures (For Troubleshooting Only)

If the automated MCP tool fails and you need to troubleshoot specific issues manually, follow these procedures:

### Prerequisites Check
```pwsh
# Verify Windows version compatibility
Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object WindowsProductName, WindowsVersion

# Check if running as Administrator - REQUIRED for service installation
if (-NOT ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal] [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator"))
{
    Write-Error "Administrative privileges are REQUIRED for service installation and testing."
    Write-Host "Please restart PowerShell or VS Code as Administrator and try again." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Write-Host "To elevate: Right-click PowerShell/VS Code -> 'Run as Administrator'" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    exit 1
}

Write-Host "✓ Running with Administrator privileges" -ForegroundColor Green

# Verify build artifacts exist
$buildPath = ".\contrib\win32\openssh\x64\Release"
if (-not (Test-Path "$buildPath\sshd.exe") -or -not (Test-Path "$buildPath\ssh.exe")) {
    Write-Error "Build artifacts not found. Please build the project first."
    exit 1
}

Write-Host "✓ Build artifacts verified" -ForegroundColor Green
```

### Test Environment Setup

### Service Installation and Configuration

#### Step 1: Install SSH Service
```pwsh
# Navigate to build directory
cd .\contrib\win32\openssh\x64\Release

# Install SSH server service with PowerShell script
.\install-sshd.ps1

# Verify service installation
Get-Service sshd -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Name, Status, StartType
```

#### Step 2: Configure SSH Service
```pwsh
# Start SSH service
Start-Service sshd

# Verify service is running
Get-Service sshd | Select-Object Name, Status
```

#### Step 3: Configure Windows Firewall (if needed)
```pwsh
# Allow SSH through Windows Firewall
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "SSH Server (sshd)" -Direction Inbound -Port 22 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Basic Functionality Tests

### Test 1: SSH Client Connection
```pwsh
# Test local connection (most basic test)
$username = $env:USERNAME
$hostname = "localhost"

Write-Host "Testing SSH connection: ssh $username@$hostname"

# Basic connection test
.\ssh.exe $username@$hostname "echo 'SSH connection successful'"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
SSH connection successful
```

## Error Diagnosis and Troubleshooting

### Run SSH Server in Debug Mode
```pwsh
# Enable SSH daemon debug logging
Stop-Service sshd
.\sshd.exe -ddd

# In another terminal, test connection with verbose client logging
.\ssh.exe -vvv $username@$hostname
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Service Won't Start
**Symptoms:**
- Service fails to start
- Event log shows service errors

**Diagnosis:**
```pwsh
# Check event logs
Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Where-Object {$_.ProviderName -eq "Service Control Manager" -and $_.Id -eq 7034} | Select-Object -First 5

# Check sshd configuration
.\sshd.exe -T
```

**Common Solutions:**
- Verify configuration file syntax

#### Issue 2: Connection Timeouts
**Symptoms:**
- SSH client hangs
- Connection timeout errors

**Diagnosis:**
```pwsh
# Check network connectivity
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 22

# Check Windows Firewall rules
Get-NetFirewallRule | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*SSH*"}
```

## Success Criteria

**Testing is successful when:**
- [ ] All expected executables are present after build (verified by Test-OpenSSHBuild MCP tool)
- [ ] SSH service installs and starts without errors
- [ ] SSH validation succeeds via either password authentication (standard) or `ssh localhost` key-based auth (entra-id-debug-localhost)
- [ ] Test command executes successfully via SSH connection
- [ ] All resources cleaned up properly after testing


## AI Agent Guidelines

1. **Use automated testing tools** whenever possible - use the Test-OpenSSHFunctionality MCP tool over manual procedures
2. **Run tests incrementally** during the merge process, not just at the end
3. **Document any test failures** and their resolutions in commit messages
4. **Pay special attention to Windows-specific functionality** that might be affected by upstream changes
5. **Always verify cleanup** - ensure test users, services, and firewall rules are removed
6. **Report any new functionality** that needs additional testing procedures

### Recommended Testing Workflow for AI Agents

1. **After successful build**, run the automated functionality test:
   - **MCP Tool Name**: `mcp_openssh-server_Test_OpenSSHFunctionality`
   - **Parameters**: (use defaults)

  If the prompt declares `Validation scenario=entra-id-debug-localhost`, use the Entra-ID debug localhost flow instead:
  - Run `.\sshd.exe -ddd` in one terminal
  - Run `ssh localhost` in another terminal
  - Report outcome from both client connection behavior and server debug logs

2. **If test passes**, the merge is validated for basic SSH functionality

3. **If test fails**, use manual procedures and debug mode to diagnose issues

4. **Document results** in commit message or merge documentation

## Manual Test Environment Cleanup

If you ran manual tests instead of using the automated tool:

```pwsh
# Clean up test environment
Stop-Service sshd -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
cd .\contrib\win32\openssh\x64\Release
.\uninstall-sshd.ps1

# Remove firewall rule
Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "SSH Server (sshd)" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Remove any test users manually created
Remove-LocalUser -Name "test_username" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Write-Host "Test environment cleaned up"
```

**Note:** The automated Test-OpenSSHFunctionality.ps1 tool handles all cleanup automatically, even on failure.
